Hi, my name is Francesco Paolucci and Iâ€™m a computer scientis from Perugia, Italy. I recently graduated from the University of Bologna on the master course called "Software Technics", an overtour on the most common latest technologies (machine learning, scalable programming, AI). I have lived in Bologna for the last four years and now I moved back to my hometown.

Working on my thesis I have discovered a big passion about Digital Publbishing and Typography. I have always been a fond reader and the possibility of joining my studies and my greates interest seemed perfect. 

I love reading comics, since I was a little. I'm a vinyl addict, music guided me through all my life. On my freetime I have fun making comedy videos for my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/franklyn.mrshankly/ "Instagram"). I used to be an hardcore gamer, but unfortunatlly the day is still 24h only and as a computer scientis I need to sleep at least a couple of hours.

If you want to know more about me you can download my [resume](./curriculumVitae3.pdf) or have a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-paolucci-064aa61a5/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/sanofrank) page.
