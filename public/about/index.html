I have lived in Bologna for the last four years and now I moved back to my hometown.</p>
<p>Working on my thesis I have discovered a big passion about Digital Publbishing and Typography. I have always been a fond reader and the possibility of joining my studies and my greates interest seemed perfect.</p>
<p>I love reading comics, since I was a little. I&rsquo;m a vinyl addict, music guided me through all my life. On my freetime I have fun making comedy videos for my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/franklyn.mrshankly/" title="Instagram">Instagram</a>. I used to be an hardcore gamer, but unfortunatlly the day is still 24h only and as a computer scientis I need to sleep at least a couple of hours.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about me you can download my <a href="curriculumVitae3.pdf">resume</a> or have a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-paolucci-064aa61a5/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sanofrank">GitHub</a> page.</p>
